    // The data member, "TimerIsRunning" is used to keep track of
    // whether a timer is active, i.e. whether an event is being
    // timed. While we want those using the timer class to know when a
    // timer is active, we do NOT want them to directly access the
    // TimerIsRunning variable. We solve this problem, by making
    // TimerIsRunning private and providing the public "access function"
    // below.

    // This function allows a client to determine the amount of time that has
    // elapsed on a timer object. Note that there are two possibilities:

    // 1) A timer object has been started and stopped. We can detect this
    // case, because the variable "TimerIsRunning" is false.

    // 2) A timer object is "running", i.e. is still in the process of timing
    // an event. It is not expected that this case will occur as frequently
    // as case 1).

    // In either case, this function converts ticks to seconds. Note that
    // since the function TicksPerSecond() returns a value of type double,
    // an implicit type conversion takes place before doing the division
    // required in either case.
