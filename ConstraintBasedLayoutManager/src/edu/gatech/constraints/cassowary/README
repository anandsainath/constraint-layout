Also see ../IMPORTANT for some important notes that you mustn't overlook.

Cassowary/Java was developed using the JDK 1.1.3 port for Linux.  It has 
been tested with JDK 1.1.7 for Linux, also.

Before trying to build Cassowary/Java, be sure to include the directory
java/classes in your CLASSPATH environment variable, e.g., if you untar
the distribution in $HOME, then add: $HOME/cassowary/java/classes to
your $CLASSPATH.  My CLASSPATH looks like this:

/usr/local/.licensed/jdk/lib/classes.zip:/homes/gws/gjb/cassowary/java/classes

Be sure you give configure the '--enable-java-build' option if you want
this directory to be processed. Then you can just use `make all' (GNU
Make) to build the .class files.  

If you want to use the Java parser, you need the JavaCup package:

 http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/


Be sure to get at least v10k-b2 or later. You'll also need JLex from:

 http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/index.html

Uncompress the JavaCUP package from a directory that is contained in
your $CLASSPATH.  Also put JLex's single Main.class into a directory 
in your $CLASSPATH and compile it.  Then run

java java_cup.Main < ClReader.cup

to create parser.java, sym.java.  (The makefile does this for you if
JavaCUP and JLex .class files are in your $CLASSPATH as described above).

Cassowary was tested with java_cup_v10k.tar.gz.

Try running ClTests after the build completes.  Be sure your CLASSPATH
is set correctly (as discussed above) and do:

java ClTests


The demos/ subdirectory contains the quadrilateral demo;  `make run'
should run it using the appletviewer after building it.  If you get
a:

 java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission ...)

error with Java 2, you may need to update your $HOME/.java.policy file.
You can try making it containt the below three lines (BEWARE: this may
be dangerous from a security perspective):

 grant {
	permission java.security.AllPermission;
 };


The cda/ subdirectory contains Michael Noth's Constraint Drawing
Application.  `make run' from the cda/ directory should run it using the
appletviewer after building it.  For more information about the CDA,
see:

http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cda/info.html

The CDA is supplied as *unsupported* software.  Feel free to submit bug
reports, etc., but we do not expect to maintain the code.
